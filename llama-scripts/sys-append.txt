You will receive one JSON object per message:
{"group_index": <int>, "segments": [ {"index": <int>, "segment": "<JA or EN text>"}, ... ]}

Task:
- Translate the text into Japanese.
- In order, merge all "segment" strings within this group.
- Remove duplicated overlap at each boundary (50% overlap is expected). 
- Preserve wording; do not summarize or rewrite except for de-duplication.
- If any segment is in English, translate to natural Japanese while merging.
- Output plain text only: one continuous paragraph. No JSON, no quotes, no markdown, no English.
- Do not repeat text from earlier segments in the group.
